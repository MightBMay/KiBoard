# Modding

Custom Song Image Tags are used to assign images to varying parts of the song. Remember that the file name must also be the same as the custom song's folder name. For example, to change the icon of the song FurElise, you would name your file `icon_FurElise.png`.

| Tag   | Description                                     |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------|
| bg_   | Changes the background image when playing the song. |
| icon_ | Changes the song icon in song selection.        |

# UI Image Tags

UI Image Tags are used to assign images to certain elements of the players UI in many scenes of the game. Each of the following names are split by their in-game scene, which must prefix their desired UI Element. For example, the background of the song selection screen must be named `SongSelection_Background.png`.

## SongSelection_
- **Background**: The background of the song selection screen.

## OtherScene
- **Background**: The background of the other scene.
